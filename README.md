# To Use on Repl.it
 - Type what you want to translate in `input.txt`
   - The rune translator will match the placement of what you type so insert your own newlines as desired

- Press Run **|>**
- Your text will be translated to `output.png`

# To Use Locally
The only dependencies for local users are python3, the python math library (should be included standard) and the pycairo library which can be installed with `pip3 install pycairo`. Instead of `press run`, after inputting your text type `python3 main.py` in your shell

### Example of Curser
> This is mostly just a reminder for myself
The curser is positioned at the `+` below relative to the space given each character


```
 ----+---- -
 |       | H
 |       | e
 |       | i 
 |       | g
 |       | h
 |       | t 
 --------- -

```
